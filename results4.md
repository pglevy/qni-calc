# If you currently have a fever your end of isolation date cannot be calculated yet.

- You should isolate for at least 5 full days. After 5 days, you should wait to end your isolation until you are fever-free for 24 hours without the use of fever-reducing medication and other symptoms have improved.
- Wear a well-fitting mask around other people and do not travel for at least 10 full days and until 24 hours after your fever ends.
- You can use this tool again when your fever ends to calculate the date you can leave your home.
- Contact your healthcare provider if you have any questions.
