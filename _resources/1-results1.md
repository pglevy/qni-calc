- Monitor your symptoms. If you have an emergency warning sign, such as trouble breathing or persistent chest pain or pressure, seek emergency medical care immediately.
- Stay in a separate room from other household members, if possible.
- Use a separate bathroom, if possible.
- Take steps to improve ventilation at home, if possible.
- Avoid contact with other members of the household and pets.
- Don't share personal household items, like cups, towels, and utensils.
- Wear a well-fitting mask when you need to be around other people.
- If you are unable to wear a mask when around others, you should continue to isolate for 10 days.
- Avoid people who have weakened immune systems or are more likely to get very sick from COVID-19, and nursing homes and other high-risk settings, until after at least 10 days.
- Do not travel for 10 days.
- Contact your healthcare provider if you have any questions.
