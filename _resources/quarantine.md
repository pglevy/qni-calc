- If possible, stay away from people you live with, especially people who are at higher risk for getting very sick from COVID-19, as well as others outside your home throughout the full 10 days after your last close contact with someone with COVID-19.
- If you are unable to quarantine, you should wear a well-fitting mask for 10 days when around others at home and public.
- If you are unable to wear a mask when around others, you should continue to quarantine for 10 days.
- If you do not develop symptoms, get tested at least 5 days after you last had close contact with someone with COVID-19. If you test negative, you can leave your home, but continue to wear a well-fitting mask when around others at home, in public, and when traveling until 10 days after your last close contact with someone with COVID-19.
- Do not travel for 5 days. If possible avoid travel through day 10.
