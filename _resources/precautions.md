- Wear a mask when you're in public, when traveling, and at home to keep others safe for 10 days from the time you were around the person who had COVID-19.
- If you can't wear a mask around other people, stay home and away from other people for 10 days after your last close contact.
- Do not go to places where you are unable to wear a mask.
- Avoid being around people who are at high risk.
