If you test positive and are an older adult or someone who is at [high risk](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/index.html){: .usa-link} of getting very sick from COVID-19, [treatment](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/treatments-for-severe-illness.html){: .usa-link} may be available. Contact a healthcare provider right away after a positive test to determine if you are eligible, even if your symptoms are mild right now. You can also visit a [Test to Treat](https://aspr.hhs.gov/TestToTreat/Pages/default.aspx){: .usa-link} location and, if eligible, receive a prescription from a provider. Donâ€™t delay: Treatment must be started within the first few days to be effective.
